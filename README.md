How to reproduce
---
If you run ``npm run dev`` and head over to ``localhost:3000/redirect`` you will see the list of the current files  
However if you go to ``localhost:3000`` and click on ``redirect`` you will see ``Failed to resolve module specifier 'fs'`` instead  
In both cases, the console note that
```
'fs' is imported by src/routes/redirect.svelte, but could not be resolved â€“ treating it as an external dependency
```
